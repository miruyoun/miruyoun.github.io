# GBH Impact & Equity: Boston Bus Equity

A data-driven analysis of **MBTA bus ridership, delays, and equity impacts** across Boston (2019–2023). This project was completed in collaboration with **GBH** and **BU Spark!**.

---

## 🚀 Highlights
- Compared ridership trends pre- vs post-COVID.  
- Analyzed travel times, delays, and reliability across key routes.  
- Assessed service disparities for **Environmental Justice communities**.  

> ### ℹ️ What Are Environmental Justice (EJ) Neighborhoods?  
> In Massachusetts, **Environmental Justice (EJ) neighborhoods** are census block groups where residents are more likely to face disproportionate burdens from environmental or infrastructure decisions.  
>  
> A neighborhood is officially designated as EJ if it meets **one or more** of these criteria:  
> - Median household income ≤ **65%** of the statewide median.  
> - Population is ≥ **40% minority**.  
> - ≥ **25% of households** lack an adult fluent in English.  
>  
> Many Boston neighborhoods — including **Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, and East Boston** — are classified as EJ communities. Because these areas often **rely more heavily on public transit**, service delays and inequities in MBTA operations have a disproportionate impact on residents’ daily lives.
