    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Master’s student in Data Science at Boston University, with a background in Environmental Science 
        from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My academic and project experience spans machine learning, 
        reinforcement learning, and graph neural networks, as well as big data systems and cloud technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like applying data science to all sorts of real-world problems, but I have a genuine passion for using 
        it in environmental domains such as ecology, sustainability, and climate. I enjoy exploring how computational 
        methods can generate insights that drive meaningful action in addressing environmental challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond coursework, I’ve tutored students in coding, statistics, and machine learning, helping them strengthen 
        their technical foundation. I aim to leverage my technical expertise and problem-solving skills to contribute 
        to impactful, data-driven decision-making in both research and industry settings.
