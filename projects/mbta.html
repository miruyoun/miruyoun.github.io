    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Boston‚Äôs public transportation has a rich history spanning nearly 400 years. Today, the MBTA 
        serves over 1 million passengers and contributes an estimated $11.5 billion annually to the 
        Greater Boston economy. This project delivers a detailed analysis of MBTA bus performance 
        between 2019 and 2023, with a focus on ridership trends, travel times, delays, and equity impacts.
      </p>

    <!-- Data Collection -->
    <section>
      <h2>Data Collection and Cleaning</h2>
      <p>
        Data were sourced from the MBTA Open Data Portal, including ridership counts, bus arrival/departure 
        times, and demographic surveys. Ridership calculations were based on automatic passenger counts 
        and fare collection data. Data preprocessing included handling inconsistencies in boardings vs. 
        alightings, missing values, and aligning scheduled vs. actual departure times to better capture 
        waiting times and delays.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The MBTA bus system experienced significant ridership decline during the pandemic, 
        with gradual recovery by 2023. However, service disparities remain: routes serving 
        Environmental Justice communities tend to face longer delays and reliability issues. 
        Addressing these disparities is essential to ensuring equitable access to public transit 
        in Boston. Data-driven improvements such as increased service frequency and targeted 
        scheduling can help reduce inequities and enhance transit reliability.
